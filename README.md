### 💡Project Overview {#project-overview}

This database semseter website project is aimed at organizing and preserving family recipes. It focuses on designing a structured database schema to efficiently manage recipe data, ensuring that treasured family recipes can be stored and accessed easily at any time.

The purpose of this project is to design, develop, and implement a robust database to support the functionalities of the website. The database incorporates key entities such as recipes, ingredients, users, reviews, and nutritional facts. In addition to preserving recipes, the project encourages user interaction allowing users to provide feedback, rate recipes, and engage with the community.

### ❗ Why This Project Matters

This project matters because effective database design is critical for minimizing redundancy and ensuring data consistency. It also demonstrates how to handle complex relationships, such as recipes, ingredients, and steps. It takes the knowledge of SQL and apply it to a working website where core principles are applied like create, retrieve, update, and delete.
